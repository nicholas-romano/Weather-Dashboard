## Usage 
1.  When the application is launched in the browser, the user can then search for weather data based on city name by typing the name in the box and clicking the magnifying glass button.  ![Weather-Dashboard-Initial-Page](/images/Weather-Dashboard-Initial-Page.png)  
2.  After a city is searched on, if a matching city is found from the API request, that city search item will be saved in a list on the left side. That same search can be made again simply by clicking on that saved search item. The “Clear search history” button is displayed when at least one saved search item is displayed. Clicking this button removes all previously saved search cities. ![Weather-Dashboard-Search-Item](/images/Weather-Dashboard-Search-Item.png)  
3.  That city’s single day forecast is displayed in the main content area on the right including city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index level. The index level is color-coded based on the severity (green is low, yellow is light, orange is high, red is extreme). ![images/Weather-Dashboard-Current-Day](/Weather-Dashboard-Current-Day.png)  
4.  Just below that is the Five-Day Forecast which displays the weather forecast at the current time for the next five days including the date, weather icon, temperature, and humidity percentage. For example, if it is currently 3pm, it will display the weather forecasted for 3pm tomorrow, 3pm for the next day, and so forth for five days. ![Weather-Dashboard-Five-Day-Forecast](/images/Weather-Dashboard-Five-Day-Forecast.png) 
5.  The saved searches are stored in the browser’s local storage, so when the browser is closed and re-opened again or the browser is refreshed, all of the previously searched for cities will display back on the page with the last searched city displayed as the active one.
